This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in VBScript: runtime errors due to late binding. Late binding, while offering flexibility, can lead to unexpected failures if an object or method does not exist at runtime. The `bug.vbs` file illustrates this issue with Excel automation; the `bugSolution.vbs` file provides a more robust solution.  The solution includes error handling to gracefully manage potential failures.
